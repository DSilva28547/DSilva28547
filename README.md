I'm Dominick Silva, a biomedical engineering graduate passionate about designing and developing innovative medical devices that improve patient care. I specialize in CAD modeling, prototyping, and product development, with hands-on experience using tools like SolidWorks, MATLAB, and Python.

I'm currently seeking entry-level opportunities in medical device R&D, quality assurance, or product development.
